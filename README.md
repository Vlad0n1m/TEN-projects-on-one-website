# Ten Projects
## _My django practice month..._

I found a list of projects that every django developer must have in his portfolio.

## Projects
### Beginner
- ToDo App
- Weather App
- Poll App
- Quiz App
- Chat App
- Resume App
- Blog Website
## Advanced
- An E-Commerce App
- Video Chat App
- Quiz App using RestAPI

But I'd like to add some difficulty into this practice plan as an organising all of this apps on my one big as a portfolio website, to make it easy to walkthrough all of my skills and experience. Also, as a FullStack, I woun't let  my site being looked ugly so I also will learn lot's of frontend features...

> In the future I will add
> all of the instructions
> and documentations

Give me luck and concentration... X_X
